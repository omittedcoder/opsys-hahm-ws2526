# 1. Program a shell script, which reads two numbers as command line arguments. The
# script should check whether the numbers are identical, and print out the result of
# the check.


# 2. Extend the shell script in a way that if the numbers are not identical, it is checked,
# which one of the two numbers is the larger one. The result of the check should be
# printed out.


# 3. Program a shell script, which reads so long text on the command line, until it is
# terminated by typing END. The script should convert the text, which is read in from
# the command line, to uppercase.
